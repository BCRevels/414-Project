Thank you for choosing our GUI as your preferred method of using Youtube-DL!
Before you begin downloading videos, there's a few things you need to make sure of first.

1. In order for Youtube-DL to correctly download and convert the videos into an appropriate format for maximum video and audio quality, you need FFMPEG.
   FFMPEG is a cross-platform solution to converting streamed video and audio into an acceptable format. You can find the download here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/  
   We do NOT  have a license to distribute anything that uses the official video formats supported by Youtube-DL such as MP4, MPEG, and so forth. Therefore we cannot include the official code in our work.

2. Make sure that FFMPEG is in a location that is accessible by your Youtube-DL.exe file. Including it wherever the .exe is or inside of your /PATH are both acceptable methods.

3. Check here to make sure you have all of the required redistributables required to run Youtube-DL  https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html

4. Have fun downloading! Below is a step by step to using the GUI.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING YOUTUBE-DL GUI

(First, go set a download directory before you begin downloading. At the moment this will need to be set every time you open the GUI)

1. Input a valid Youtube URL (A single video or a Playlist URL will both work)

2. Check a box to specify if you want Video and Audio (Together), just Video, just Audio, or Video and Audio (Separate files)

3. Choose a Video format (.MPEG, .mov, .mp4)

4. Choose an audio format (.mp3, .m4a, .wav, .flac)

5. Input what you wish to name the file (or click the checkbox for it to be named whatever the video's official title is)

6. Click Start download

There are a few errors which might occur when using the GUI. First and foremost, CHECK YOUR YOUTUBE DL VERSION AND UPDATE. Youtube is constantly updating its algorithms to try and thwart Youtube-DL. Often, you will simply need to update to the latest version or check to see if the current build is not working because of changes. The Youtube-DL team is usually quick to fix any issues. 

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q. Does this GUI work with Playlists?

A. Yes, but in terms of naming each individual video, it will be the default for every single one AFTER the first one.

Q. My videos are not downloading in the directory I set up last time I used the GUI, why is that?

A. At the moment, we have not implemented a way to save your desired directory throughout uses, you will have to specify the directory each time you start the GUI.

Q. Who is Joe?

A. Joe Mama!

Q. Why can I not select a specific resolution for the videos?

A. Each video has a different selection of available qualities and formats, so we would have to implement a dynamic scroll bar, which is a pain.
